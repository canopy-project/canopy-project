    <section title="Abstract">
        This document describes the security features of the Canopy Engine,
        including a discussion of potential threats and vulnerabilities of the
        platform and how they are (or may be) mitigated.

    <section title="Introduction">
        <p>
            The Internet of Things brings new opportunities for a smarter,
            safer and more efficient world.  But these new opportunities bring
            new security threats with potentially serious consequences.
            Increasingly, digital attacks can manifest in the physical world.
            This could mean an attacker discovering your location, opening your
            garage door or even starting an oven fire in your home.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Canopy, we take security seriously because we understand the
            implications are real.  Sadly, "Secrurity through Obscurity" is the
            status quo throughout the industry, particularly among proprietary
            IoT platforms.  Competing platforms may claim to be secure, but
            their code is not available for rigorous scrutiny by the worldwide
            developer community, so can you trust them?
        </p>

        <p>
            Since Security through Obscurity is widely regarded a fallacy, we
            take the opposite approach: full transparency.  By openly sharing
            our code and having an ongoing dialog about potential
            vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them, we can build deservingly
            trusted software.

<chapter title="Security Features">
    <section title="TLS Everywhere">
        All interactions between a Canopy Client and Canopy Server can be
        configured to occur over HTTPS or WSS.
    </section>
    <section title="Per-Device Credentials">
        Canopy requires that every device has a unique ID and Secret Key for
        API authentication purposes.
    </section>
    <section title="Cloud Permission System">
        The Canopy Permission System (codenamed "IoTAuth") is highly granular
        and supports policies that follow the "Principal of Least Privilege".
    </section>
    <section title="Thorough API Unit Testing">
        Some record attacks on web services go through "the front door" when
        buggy code changes cause incomplete authorization checks.  Canopy's
        unit test suite prevents this type of regression.
